# Car-Dataset-EDA-And-Price-Prediction-Using-Various-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

This repository contains notebooks and code for analyzing a dataset of used cars and building a machine learning model to predict their prices. The project is divided into two main components:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
2. **Feature Engineering and Price Prediction**
   
## Project Overview

The project aims to extract insights from a dataset of used cars and develop a machine learning model to predict car prices. This involves:

1. Exploring the dataset to understand its structure and uncover patterns.
2. Cleaning and preprocessing the data.
3. Engineering relevant features to improve model performance.
4. Building and evaluating machine learning models for price prediction.

## Methods and Procedures

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Data Overview**: Inspected the dataset's structure, identified missing values, and determined data types.
2. **Visualizations**: Created plots to understand distributions, relationships, and trends (e.g., scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps).
3. **Insights**: Highlighted key findings regarding factors influencing used car prices.

### Feature Engineering and Price Prediction

1. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Addressed missing values.
   - Encoded categorical features.
   - Generated new features (e.g., age of the car, mileage bins).
2. **Modeling**:
   - Experimented with multiple regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
   - Tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.
   - Evaluated models using metrics like RMSE and R^2.

      **Machine Learning ALgorithms Used**
      1. Linear Regression
      2. Lasso Regression
      3. Ridge Regression
      4. K-Neighbors Regressor
      5. Decision Tree Regressor
      6. Random Forest Regressor
      7. XGBRegressor
      8. CatBoost Regressor
      9. AdaBoost Regressor


## Result
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Provided actionable insights into the factors affecting car prices.
- **Model Performance**:
  1. Achieved R² scores of 0.96 for training and 0.94 for testing following data collection, exploratory data analysis, and      preprocessing.
  2. Best model is CATBoost Regressor with 94.37% R2 Score.
